Ideas for covid 19 xray

Dataset:

Can we work on both CT -scan and xray dataset? 

Methods:

Deep learning, classification, regression etc are done. 



Clustering only

OR

Building regression, classification, clustering, RNN, Cnn etc and say which one performed the best.

What other novelty we can do in our project since many algorithms are used on this topic.
